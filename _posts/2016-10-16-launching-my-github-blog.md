If you have ever visited my website www.helengrives.nl, you probably know about the long recovery from thyroid cancer and chronique fatigue. It does not matter if you don't, but it gives some perspective about reinventing oneself.

So I asked myself these questions:
- What jobs can be done independent, remote and from a couch or bed?
- What are the things I am good at?
- What do I like the do?
- What visions and dreams do I have?

These few questions guided me into two directions. Forex trading and my long wish to learn to code. Both because they are intellectually challenging and the latter because it is another language that potentially could transform my vision from idea into a product.

This blog is my learning space into the journey of programming. Something to put my experiences, observations and a kind of repository of just one of many ways to reinvent oneself.
